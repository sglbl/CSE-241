Hello teacher, 
I created a menu which will test both three classes ( HashSet, ArrayList and LinkedList )
I override the toString() method to print the collection.

Also for error checking and error throwing, I used "7) Test Errors". With that you can see some errors thrown.
Also in Test class, every function(method) used. You can choose which class collection to use. In Test class I created collections with generics, named ex1 and ex2.
-----------------------
And I used ex1 and ex2 to use the methods in other classes.

Thank you for reading these.
