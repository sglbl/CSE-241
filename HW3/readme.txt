Hello teacher, 
I created a game function in menu called 
"6) Load 5 saved games from my file to check easily. "
for you. So if you don't want create or open games orderly you can check my function.
It loads EX1.TXT, EX2.TXT, EX3.TXT, EX4.TXT, EX5.TXT . And it is ready for your check.
----------
In game when you are playing,
if you write "LOAD NAME.TXT" , it loads NAME.TXT file.
if you write "SAVE NAME.TXT" , it saves NAME.TXT file.
if you write "RBACK" , it goes back to main menu without deleting the this class obejct.
------------
When you create empty Hex games in main menu, game names starts with 0. 
For example game0. After that, with order it continious to name game1, game2 etc.

Thank you for reading these.
